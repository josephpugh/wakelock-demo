00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:09.230
Joe Pugh: How are you today? Hey, good, thank you. Thank you.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:41.460
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh, my little, my little puppy cat. White chocolate coop. He always has to throw a cute little teddy bear side. Hi, good evening, how are you? Good, thank you. Awesome, awesome. So, my name's Nikki, of course, as you know. Well, my name is Nicolevia, but I go by Nikki. I'm CSS working with Bill Mayo. I know we recently did a little transfer of financial advisors, she does.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:01:23.334
Speaker 1: Michael isn't going to retire in February, and we wanted to make sure that all of his accounts that are a little further out because of the time difference, you know, we have… this is kind of how we, Sorry, I can't really explain it, but, it's kind of how we just had it set up to where all of the more Midwestern accounts and Eastern accounts, again, that time difference wouldn't be an issue for you guys. So, thank you so much for being with us today. I am just going to do a quick checkup on your account to make sure that everything is current, and then Bill's gonna come in right after. Okay. I have so many questions. Did you guys have any questions before I get started?

00:01:23.335 --> 00:01:25.470
Joe Pugh: No, no, no, let's go ahead.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:44.074
Speaker 1: Alright, so first and foremost, I'm going to start with you, Paula. We have your cell at 333-333-3333. That's correct. Yes. Awesome. And then, so, yours, 333-333-3333.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.609
Joe Pugh: 1. Yes, that's right.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:02:00.349
Speaker 1: Okay, awesome. And are you guys still at 178 Ward Drive in Chapel, North Carolina? Chapel Hill? Yeah. Yes. Perfect. Joe, your email, we have you as I… I'm sorry.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:28.525
Speaker 1: It's LTD at female.com? That's correct. Okay, thank you. And for you, Paula, we have yet is it you? Yes. Is that how you pronounce it? Yes. Hugh? gmail.com. That's correct. Perfect. And what's your preferred form of communication for you both? We can do email, text, or phone.

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:32.670
Joe Pugh: Email's good. Email, yeah. Yeah, email's perfect. Email's good.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:52.039
Speaker 1: And did you have some other sacrifices on hand as well? Yeah. Let's take that in the system. Okay, I am ready. We can start with… We could start with you, Paula. We just need the… Number, issue date, and the expiration date.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.850
Speaker 5: owed my license.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.785
Speaker 1: Yes, of your license, and I'm assuming it is for North Carolina.

00:02:57.785 --> 00:03:19.300
Speaker 5: Yes, it is. So, the license number is, 4444. 4444. And the expiration date is 08-09-2033.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:36.785
Speaker 1: Okay, so for that… for the ID number, I have 44444444. That's correct. Okay, and then the expiration date, August 22, 2033. What's the issue date?

00:03:36.785 --> 00:03:42.330
Speaker 5: The issue date is 03-09-2025.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.224
Speaker 1: And I am ready for mute, though, starting with Sarah.

00:03:50.225 --> 00:04:11.970
Joe Pugh: Sure, it's 3333… 1, 2, 7, 3… Issue date 03-15-2025. And expiry date 04-29-2033.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:35.149
Speaker 1: Beautiful. I'll go ahead and update that in the system, and then onto your account. We just have to join a joint account with you both. We do not have a trusted contact listed. Is there anyone that you'd like to add? We don't share any personal information, just someone we can reach out to if we can't get ahold of you both.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:44.659
Joe Pugh: Yeah, we'll… if we can think of one and I'll come back, I don't know if we'd have their details right now, but yeah, we'll take that as something to come back to you with, if that's all right.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.015
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely, I can send an email as well.

00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:50.270
Joe Pugh: Perfect, yeah, that would be ideal, thank you.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:59.094
Speaker 1: Perfect, and then also another, the beneficiary. We don't have a beneficiary listed. Would you like to add the pup?

00:04:59.095 --> 00:05:11.290
Joe Pugh: It would be the kids. Yeah, I would think we should probably leave something to the kids, like, so… Yeah, we'll make sure that we do that, but I… I mean, if the beneficiary isn't either of us, then it will be the children, so…

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.784
Speaker 5: But yeah, we can do that, yeah, we'll dissat afterwards.

00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:24.179
Speaker 1: All right, we'll need their, their full name, date of birth, and the social security number, and I'll have that in an email as well. Got it.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.720
Joe Pugh: No, we're easy items.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:52.164
Speaker 1: And then lastly, we have a Bank of America joint checking account, and again, 4421, is that still current? Yes, it is. All right, beautiful. I will make sure that that's current, and then again, I will send an email out for the, for those updates, for the trusted contacts and the beneficiaries. Great. Yeah, how's the, how's the day going? Still, you should be coming in, right?

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:57.425
Joe Pugh: Yeah. Well, coming to the end, coming to the weekend, this is good.

00:05:57.425 --> 00:06:01.110
Speaker 5: First week in January is always hard.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.380
Speaker 1: I know, I know, especially after the holidays. Did you guys do anything special?

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:14.070
Joe Pugh: Yeah, we… we were in the… yeah, we went to the UK for two weeks, so we only got back last Sunday, so this will be our… this is our first week back.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.195
Speaker 1: I see and I notice, are you guys, have family there?

00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:24.195
Joe Pugh: Yeah, we're from there originally. Been here 11 years now, but yeah, from the UK originally. 11 years? Yeah.

00:06:24.195 --> 00:06:35.200
Speaker 1: Okay, beautiful, beautiful. Well, it was really nice meeting you both, and have filled us in, and yeah, if you have any questions, you can always reach out to me, and I'll send that to email for you guys, so…

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.820
Joe Pugh: Have a good appointment. Thank you, thank you, appreciate it.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.199
Speaker 4: Thanks, Nikki.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.889
Joe Pugh: Hey guys, how you doing? Hey, hey, good, thank you. How you doing?

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.275
Speaker 4: Good, good. I see some drums in the background.

00:06:47.275 --> 00:07:03.025
Joe Pugh: Our eldest daughter, she's the drummer. She's been doing it, like, five years. It's funny, I use the same Zoom for, like, work meetings, and every new person, I have the same… it's always the same thing. I feel like it should be me, but it's not me. It's her, our eldest. She's awesome.

00:07:03.025 --> 00:07:13.095
Speaker 4: I just think of my four kids, and how much racket they'd be causing on those drums. I've got one kid that's saying he wants to learn how to play drums. I'm like,

00:07:13.095 --> 00:07:16.799
Joe Pugh: Yeah, yeah, I'm explaining this.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:41.934
Speaker 4: Well, good, good. I'm glad we could, touch base here, you know, I don't know what plans you guys have for the meeting. I plan to not get too technical. I kind of want just to get to know you guys, and… you know, C… what kind of direction you're wanting to go, or what maybe I can do for you. You know, so that was kind of what I was thinking. I don't know about you guys.

00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:51.760
Joe Pugh: No, I think that's ideal. Like, if you lead, like, I don't think we have any kind of pre… pre-con… pre-sort notions of what to do here. So, yeah, if you want to lead, that would be ideal.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:08:02.169
Speaker 4: Yeah, so… so I had a question. I was… before, obviously, we talked here, I wanted to kind of… I was kind of looking through the notes, were you guys…

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.340
Speaker 1: We…

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.555
Speaker 4: Were you having, much conversations with Michael? Were you guys working on…

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:24.650
Joe Pugh: No. No, no, not at all. And not because of him, just because we just weren't really engaged, so we've got, like, 401Ks and this brokerage account through Jones, so we're pretty much passive for all of that.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:28.610
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:44.525
Speaker 4: So, I guess… I guess then the question is, you know, what… what kind of is the goal, for the joint account? Did you have a particular goal, or is this… additional retirement savings?

00:08:44.525 --> 00:09:08.950
Joe Pugh: Yeah, it's… it's… yeah, it's all basically retirement savings, so we're trying to… we try and max out what we can put into retirement accounts each year, I think. Well, to our knowledge. But yeah, we don't have a specific… we don't have anything specific for that brokerage account at all. It's basically just… you know, pretty much you could consider it all for retirement, essentially, I would think, more or less. Yeah.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:15.940
Speaker 4: Do you guys kind of keep a close eye on it? Do you watch it, or you just kind of let it do its thing? .

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:44.309
Joe Pugh: You know, it's always nice when the market's gone up to just have a look, but I, like, not looking at it in terms of, like, anything needs changing, but just… Yeah, just very passively, occasionally, just keeping an eye on that, and then It… I think pretty much it… all of our US stuff is tied into the Edward Jones account, and, like, it's available there. We have some UK stuff that isn't, but…

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.790
Joe Pugh: That's all retirement savings as well.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:10:01.054
Speaker 4: Gotcha, gotcha. Well, since you mentioned the 401K, when was the last time you looked at it? There were some recent changes, I don't know if… they didn't do the best job of communicating these changes, so I wasn't sure if you noticed that or not.

00:10:01.055 --> 00:10:37.379
Joe Pugh: Yeah, I know… so we've been doing, like, the overpayment, and I know that event… that finally they kicked in that Roth thing, so that might be something to do… this year. I imagine we would wanna… Yeah, do the overpayment, and so… Oh, yours might be slightly… No, you're right, yeah. Paula works for the state here, and has, like, the opportunity to do the plans through that, which is quite cool, because she can actually do two plans, so she's actually maxing out the contributions on two. I think the, yeah, the over 50 one, or the over whatever it is one, we might…

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:48.100
Joe Pugh: have to put some of that as a Roth. Certainly, I might have to, which is fine, like, and I think Edward Jones will probably do it for me, maybe, or they'll ask me if I want to do it, and I might just say yes.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:11:10.194
Speaker 4: Yeah, yeah, I know there was some recent changes with that. I think there's some stipulations to it, so I can look into exactly what those stipulations are for you. What I was more referring to is the Edward Jones completely overhauled the fund lineup. So a lot of the investments you were probably used to seeing in the 401K are not there anymore.

00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:11.694
Joe Pugh: Okay. I didn't know that.

00:11:11.695 --> 00:11:14.379
Speaker 4: So, yeah, we haven't looked at it.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:36.190
Joe Pugh: Yeah, that's it… yeah, I never actually looked to the level of holdings. It's basically just kind of… proportionately in various areas… market areas, but yeah, it's interesting to know that they did that. I don't know whether we would actively look to kind of rebalance anything as a result of that, but… But we'll see. Like, it's interesting to know that, for sure.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:12:10.614
Speaker 4: If you were in any of the profit-sharing funds, they would have automatically placed you into an aged-appropriate retirement date fund. So based on roughly when you reach 65, that's the date they'd be looking for for that retirement date fund. And then if you did pick some individual investments, they would have, automatically moved into those ones that were comparable. Oh, okay. So we… we have far less options now. Basically, the goal was to symbolize… What am I trying to say? Simplify.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:50.880
Speaker 4: The goal is to simplify the options to make it easier for the average investor to you know, pick, and not overcomplicate the situation. You know, so if any point you want me to take a look at it, I'm more than happy to do so. I have to stop short of giving you specific recommendations, but I can certainly provide some guidance. You know, so that's definitely something I can help you with if you like. I would say go in, check it out. It may… The look and feel is all still the same. It's the fund… the investments that you're in, have changed recently. Okay, thank you. Since you mentioned the 401K, I wanted to throw that out there, because I didn't want to forget about it.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:13:38.529
Speaker 4: But, you know, as you said, the joint account has been performing well. You know, solid performance there. You guys are still well diversified. It could use a little TLC, but… It's nothing that's, like, dire that would need to be done, because the concern that we would have there is if we did do any rebalancing, it could potentially create, you know, a tax situation for you. So, if that's something you want to explore. I can certainly make some recommendations, try to… take advantage of any losses that you might have. I will say, fortunately, but unfortunately, you don't have a ton of losses, you know, so, more than likely, any adjustments that you'd make in the portfolio would end up being taxable. Oh, okay.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:14:10.990
Speaker 4: You know, but if that's something that's a concern, we can certainly always take a look at it. But again, I think it's well diversified, you know, and again, performance has been very good. I had a report here that actually had the numbers in it. Let me see… Yeah, here it is. So, last year, you were up about 18.5%. And then the year before that, up about…

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:51.900
Speaker 4: 8 and a little over 8 and a half, and then the year before that, almost 13. This year, it lagged a little bit. And, you know, that could be due to… I'll put it up on the board here and show you what I meant by there is some opportunity, and I think the reason why it lagged a little bit this year, and I'll show you why. Make sure I'm sharing the right screen. So, this is a diversification bar chart. This shows you how That joint account is invested.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:15:29.400
Speaker 4: So, if we look at this high-level graph, this shows the fixed income, or the bond investments. Versus all the stock investments. This right here looks fine, right? You know, we want to see the yellow somewhere in between the upper and lower limits of the green portion. So you're right there on both. So, at a high level, this seems fine. Then when we look at the actual breakdown of the investments, we see where on… where everything stacks up. So, the fixed income portion, the 23%, is made up by cash. There is no cash.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:16:14.979
Speaker 4: And then the fixed income portion. So most of that's going to be your bond investments that are in there. So about 22% of the portfolio. is in the bond portion. That looks fine. Everything looks fine there. You got a little aggressive income, not much, but we want to keep that kind of low. So that all looks fine. Where we're a little below, is… this refers to the size of the companies. Large cap. And stop me if I'm telling you something you already know, but large capitalization… so think of, like, Apple, Google, Walmart, McDonald's, you know, companies like that. Very large corporations. Some of them are focused on growth, some are focused on paying dividends.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:37.329
Speaker 4: But this should be the bulk of your portfolio. So we should have somewhere between, you know, 50% to 65% In that category. So we're at 38. This is your moneymaker right here. This is gonna be the investments that have You know, significant growth potential, but because they're large, mature companies.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:17:09.010
Speaker 4: They tend to also be more predictable. They tend to be a little bit less volatile, but certainly still volatile, right? If you look at the stock market, we know how volatile that can be. So, being underweight in this category, I think, might have hurt you a little bit. this past year, but I think the reason why everything looked so good last year versus this year is the international category. International markets did really well in 2024. They underperformed in 2025.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:42.475
Speaker 4: So being a little bit too high on the international side of things also might have hurt you guys a little bit as well. Everything else looks fine. The aggressive category is a little bit high. But, you know, it's… it's not… it's not too bad, but that's probably what's helping push up that international, because a lot of the aggressive investments tend to be Like, emerging… countries, developing countries, that kind of thing. Right. So I don't know if you've ever seen this graph before, I just wanted to kind of.

00:17:42.475 --> 00:17:50.599
Joe Pugh: No, no, no, I think that's… it's possible I've been shared it, but I've not… I don't remember seeing this, so this is really helpful. Thank you.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:18:34.320
Speaker 4: So there's a couple ways you can address this. One is you sell some things and buy other things. The drawback to that is it creates a taxable event. Now, we could actually run some numbers without actually doing anything, just to kind of give you an idea of what kind of tax situation that might create. You can run that through your tax person, see it, or if you guys do your own taxes, I don't know, but, you know. make a decision from there. Okay. The other thing is, if you were planning on doing any investing. Down the line, we, instead of trying to sell something now, we focus in this category to start bumping that up. If there's some investments, you know, like I said, in the next year or two that you guys were looking to do, we would focus on this category to try to build it up.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:50.380
Speaker 4: Or a combination of the two, you know, it just kind of depends on what you know, where you guys are at and what you're planning to do. And… or you could do nothing, I would say… I would say 8% this year.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:19:13.100
Speaker 4: Let's see… Or, sorry, 2%. I mean. That's low. It's pretty low. That's the rate of return… oh, sorry, that's this year. Last year was 18.46. 2024 was 8.69. That's a little low. But, you know… I don't think it's anything that's that big of a deal.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:21.579
Joe Pugh: Okay, yeah, yeah, we can keep an eye on that, because I guess also if there's a downturn, that might be a good opportunity to rebalance then as well, so…

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:58.409
Speaker 4: Yes, yeah, if things are down, you're buying low, you're selling low as well, so it kind of negates itself so that when the market does come back up. you know, that's coming back up as well. Okay. But I think a good strategy is if you are planning on doing more investment. focus any of those new dollars into the area where we are below it, you know? And again, if you want me to run some numbers without committing to anything, we can certainly do that, just to kind of see what that might look like. But overall, we got a good mix of investments, you got a lot of ETFs, which are good in a non-retirement account, they're more tax-sufficient.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:07.889
Speaker 4: You're not gonna love it when you go to sell them, but you don't have a lot of taxes owed year to year because of the way those investments are structured.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.210
Joe Pugh: Okay.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:24.325
Speaker 4: Okay, so… Let's see… Now, did… Did Michael ever kind of get into Money Guide? Are you familiar with Money Guide?

00:20:24.325 --> 00:20:31.030
Joe Pugh: Only from looking at it as a… Jones Associate, so not, not, as applied to us.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:58.230
Speaker 4: So, this is something that… it's obviously not required, you don't have to do this, but if it's something that… You know, if you have a burning question of, you know, when can we retire? Will our money last? We want to leave money To our kids, or we want to make…

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:18.969
Speaker 4: charitable donations, like, it helps us answer those questions, you know, in preparing for retirement. Obviously, it's not a crystal ball, but I, you know. we can get a good idea of what things kind of might look like through that analysis. As with any good analysis, the more information you put in.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:50.510
Speaker 4: the better your output is, right? So, if we don't have good information going in, any of the results that we get don't really mean anything, right? So if this wasn't something you guys have worked much with, you know, with Michael on, this is certainly something that we can you know, focus on, if you like. Again, there's… Just the service that we offer. You know, so we… with this, we want to look at the big picture. We want to look at, those 401Ks that you mentioned. You know, getting those numbers updated, added in.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:22:50.049
Speaker 4: if you have, you know, like, a mortgage, making sure that information's up to date, your general spending habits as they are right now, because those usually don't change too much. Yeah. You know, then we can also add other goals. Maybe you guys want to travel. You mentioned the UK. Maybe you guys go to the UK, a couple times a year, or once a year, or whatever, you know, budgeting all of that stuff in to make sure you can continue to do those things once you retire. Yeah, yeah. That's what this is for. And the way this analysis works is… We put the basic information in, we have our goals, all of that, and then it runs your main analysis, and it also runs a bunch of background scenarios, I don't know if you've ever heard the term Monte Carlo? Yeah. Probability analysis. So it runs thousands of different scenarios in the background to give us a probability of this working out for you. And then it'll also show you, like, best case scenario, worst case scenario.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:23:30.510
Speaker 4: You know, so maybe worst case scenario, we either run out of money, or, like, you don't quite have as much as you would, and then in best case scenario, you got $50 million to send your beneficiaries. We usually throw those two out, right? We look at what's kind of in the middle, because that's more than likely what's going to happen. But… but it does a really good job of kind of, you know, like I said, alleviating some of that concern, you know? Because I… I'm still a good 20 or so plus years away, but I can only imagine the concern of, hey, I'm no longer… I no longer have an income, and now I gotta figure out how to pay all these bills with just the things that I have accumulated. So, let me…

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:46.665
Speaker 4: Let me hop over to the goals portion. Have you guys thought much about when you wanted to retire? The system's gonna automatically default at 65, but I don't know if you guys have had any kind of conversation on that.

00:23:46.665 --> 00:24:08.610
Joe Pugh: No, and I think it's more around… when would we… like, it'd be interesting to know under what scenarios it would be an okay time to do it. Like, if that's 65, yeah, if it's sooner. Wouldn't that be nice to think about, too? It… do we get access to this… do we get access to this independently, or is it through you?

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:55.429
Speaker 4: So through online account access, you have… you have some access to this. So there's, like, a play… play zone or something like that, where you can go in, and that's what the numbers, and you can slide that retirement date back and forth and see how it changes things for… mess with your spending goal, because this revolves around spinning, right? Spinning is the key aspect. you know, and then, obviously, the investments, income, all that other stuff plays into it as well, but the most important part of this analysis is having an accurate spending goal. Oh, okay. And with the information that we have in right there, it's already kind of showing you, like.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:14.174
Speaker 4: Yeah. And again, I don't know how good this information is that is in here. We'll kind of… we'll kind of peek at it. Yeah. Just to see where it's at. But for right now, we'll leave the 65 in there, and that's something we can play with. So, goals. This was… I don't know, maybe you mentioned this at some…

00:25:14.175 --> 00:25:19.980
Joe Pugh: Yeah, I don't remember that. You could probably… you could probably take that out. Seems, seems erroneous.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:34.290
Speaker 4: Yeah, I think you… based on what you've told me, it sounds like you either surpassed that anyway. So, the spending goal in here, again, I don't know necessarily where this came from, do you know roughly about how much you guys spend?

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:57.300
Joe Pugh: each month? Yeah, ish. I think it… I think, like, annually. This year was, yeah, a special one, but maybe, like, it's more like $150, I would say. I think… Dylan 84. That would be, like, a guess, yeah, per year.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.105
Speaker 4: And so that's just, like, net expenses, right? That's not even considering taxes or anything, right?

00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:09.200
Joe Pugh: Oh, no, that would include… that includes, like, paying property tax and federal tax.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.655
Speaker 4: Property tax would be fine, but yeah, we don't want to include federal.

00:26:12.655 --> 00:26:26.589
Joe Pugh: Oh, okay, well, actually, that's only usually a… by… Most of it is calculated correctly, so that's usually only about 3,000 or $4,000 either way, so maybe we can ignore that. But yeah, the property tax would be part of the 150.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.455
Speaker 4: So what do we think, then? So you're saying 115 does not include any federal tax? Correct.

00:26:34.455 --> 00:26:45.419
Joe Pugh: Yeah, or the federal tax is really just usually kind of rounding out Like, most of it's handled reasonably well through the standard deduction from the payslip.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:27:04.409
Speaker 4: Okay. So then, what I would say is, I would challenge you guys, and we can provide one if you've never had one before, but we've got a budget worksheet. That outlines simply your typical expenses. So I think it'd be a good idea to take some time, go through

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:35.119
Speaker 4: see, you know, write down what you're spending on the various items, and really get a good idea of where the spending's coming from. Sure. And we can use that as our goal, because what this is going to do is it's… it is… we're entering it in today's dollars, but it's going to inflate it out to 15 years, or 10 years, or whatever that start… that retirement goal is. It's gonna inflate it out to that point. And then it's gonna continue to inflate it throughout, the lifetime. Got it.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:28:01.220
Speaker 4: And then we can really get in and fine-tune it using that gold portion. You know, maybe we wanna travel You know, until age… 75, or 80, or whatever, or maybe we want to travel more for, you know, 10 years, and then back it off a little bit, and then back… so we can really fine-tune the spending portion with the goal, setting the goals. Okay.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:43.930
Speaker 4: But, you know, this is going to be your basic spending that is probably not going to change, you know, your utilities, maybe going out to dinner, the table, you know, cell phone, all that fun stuff. So… We'll get that budget worksheet, and then this is something we'll work on as far as the goals, the wants, the wishes, all that. The other thing it does here is, depending upon when you retire, healthcare comes into play, right? Yeah.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:29:17.689
Speaker 4: you know, because if Medicare doesn't kick in until 65, and you retire at 60, well then, you've got to figure out how to pay for those medical expenses You know, for that period of time that you're not working. So we factored that in as well. So, Social Security, let's see… This is estimating right now. Yeah. So this is estimating based off of whatever income amounts we have on file.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:46.245
Speaker 4: So… Ideally, what we would want is an actual statement, you know? So going out, getting a Social Security statement, and then we can plug those numbers in and get a more accurate result. Because what the system is doing is, it's assuming you've made an inflation-adjusted equivalent of what you're making right now. You know, so if it's going back, you know, like, 2.5% or 3% every year prior, and going forward. Well, obviously, that's not…

00:29:46.245 --> 00:29:49.994
Joe Pugh: Yeah, because we've only been here 11 years, so yeah, so it's incomplete.

00:29:49.995 --> 00:30:14.949
Speaker 4: Yeah, he probably had big jumps, you know, at times, and smaller jumps at others. So didn't those actual numbers work up there? And then any other retirement income that you might have. Maybe you've got a rental property, or maybe, you know, you plan to work part-time, maybe you're gonna do some… You know, whatever, wherever you plan on doing, we can include that in here, and we can…

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:47.595
Speaker 4: specify the timeframes that the bad income's gonna happen. Maybe… so my… my… what I'm gonna do when I retire is… I love hockey. And I want to go be an usher at our NHL stadium, you know, for a few years or whatever. I think that would be so much fun. You know, so, you know, I wouldn't be including that on my analysis, you know? So we have some information, obviously. I don't… did you guys provide updated statements? I didn't…

00:30:47.595 --> 00:31:13.360
Joe Pugh: Every… this… everything that's in the US is on there, so this is all of our 401Ks and bank accounts. It's got your stuff, too. The only thing that we don't have in there is we do have, equivalent retirement accounts from the UK. I don't think I… there probably isn't a mechanism to add those into the system, but I know what the most recent balances of those are.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.195
Speaker 4: If that's… Would this be, like, a function program? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:31:17.195 --> 00:31:24.010
Joe Pugh: So we've got four, like, the UK equivalent of 401Ks, that we've got four of them. The UK.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.715
Speaker 4: I imagine… I imagine we could figure out how to manually put that in.

00:31:29.715 --> 00:31:35.080
Joe Pugh: Yeah, like, other… yeah, I think you had, like, other investments, maybe we could just put it under there or something.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:47.275
Speaker 4: Okay. Jeff, if you can get some statements, we can… we can figure out how to get that in. Sure. Other assets, insurance, liabilities, addressing protection.

00:31:47.275 --> 00:32:02.709
Joe Pugh: No, just credit… just the credit cards. Oh, it looks like we don't have the Amex on there, but yeah, the only… Oh, my God, be quiet. Yeah, so yeah, no liabilities other than credit cards, which is just kind of… Monthly spending, essentially.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:20.834
Speaker 4: Dog… the dogs are needing some attention. Oh my god, yeah. Always. Good debates. So then, based on that information, it comes with up with the, you know, network. Yeah. So, you guys own your home outright, I guess? That's right, yeah.

00:32:20.835 --> 00:32:21.585
Joe Pugh: down.

00:32:21.585 --> 00:32:29.010
Speaker 4: Okay. And I don't know if we're including… let's see, are we including the value?

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.075
Joe Pugh: yeah, they're shocked.

00:32:34.075 --> 00:32:37.075
Speaker 4: be clear to add that in. Okay, yeah.

00:32:37.075 --> 00:32:37.825
Joe Pugh: Ouch.

00:32:37.825 --> 00:33:01.730
Speaker 4: I'll get the wrong one. Here we go. So, if you want to dive right in… Once you get to the, you know, the insecurity over the investments, we can get over to the results. Like I said, these don't really mean a whole lot right now.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:29.204
Speaker 4: We just bumped up that spinning, we doubled it, pretty much. So, Netflix spin… And I just, like I said. I think, once we kind of fine-tune the space… Yeah. what all that 155 includes. I think once you guys kind of break it down in the budget, we can see what all is going where, and figure out how to incorporate that into the analysis. So, don't worry about this at all, because I think that's going to change. Okay, yeah.

00:33:29.205 --> 00:33:54.949
Joe Pugh: Yeah. In terms of… so the UK one, I… like, from looking at the… all of the balances, I mean, it's… I'm doing the kind of… FX conversion, I think it's about xxx. total value of the UK pensions, which… And we'd actually get something of a UK state pension. It's not much, it's not like what you get at Social Security, but it's something.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:08.764
Speaker 4: Yeah, we're not even showing any contributions going into your 401K. So there's definitely some updating we need to do. Oh, okay. Yeah, so this is… this is just.

00:34:08.764 --> 00:34:24.380
Joe Pugh: reflecting… Oh, so it's assuming that those things don't get added to… yeah, because the ones that Paula has there, the University of North Carolina, those are the two that she's maxing out. Each year, and then there's the… Jones one that's getting maxed out every year.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.405
Speaker 4: And you're maxing out your.

00:34:26.405 --> 00:34:32.600
Joe Pugh: Yeah, yeah, so, yeah, so what is it like? Xxx times 3 per year.

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.984
Speaker 4: What about, after-tax? Are you doing after-tax in the Upper Jones 401K?

00:34:37.985 --> 00:34:56.609
Joe Pugh: No, we do have two… we have a… traditional IRAs each, and so we tried to put the max into those each year. Was it about seven and a half? K, or something like that. So we… we… we've been… Maxing those.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:34.840
Speaker 4: Because Edward Jones offers… The pre-tax and the Roth 401K, where you can max those out. Once you've maxed those out, you're able to put additionally into a third bucket, which is after-tax. So it's kind of like doing a Roth contribution. But it doesn't grow tax-free, but what people end up doing is they fund the after-tax portion, and then at the end of the year, or as often as you want, they convert it into the Roth. Since it's after-tax money, it doesn't create a taxable event. It's just another way to put more money into the Roth.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:43.865
Speaker 4: portion, if you're finding that, you know, you're already maxing, you have additional money that you want to save, you can do the.

00:35:43.865 --> 00:35:49.114
Joe Pugh: Oh, okay, yeah, that's good to know. Yeah, maybe we can look at that next year. But also this… towards the end of this year, yeah.

00:35:49.115 --> 00:35:53.615
Speaker 4: show you, if you want, sometime, I can show you on the 401 how to do that.

00:35:53.615 --> 00:35:55.000
Joe Pugh: That'd be cool, thank you.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:36:05.175
Speaker 4: Okay. So both… so you're maxing out your 401K? Yeah. Wait, you're maxing out both of.

00:36:05.175 --> 00:36:08.019
Joe Pugh: Yeah, both of those plans there, yeah.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.694
Speaker 4: Are these numbers accurate? Is this where we're at?

00:36:11.695 --> 00:36:14.279
Joe Pugh: No, no, those look up to date.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:49.109
Speaker 4: Okay, I'll get that updated. And we'll get you a budget worksheet, so you guys can kind of take a look at that, because I think the spending, like I said, that's… that's… that's, like, the most important part of the entire analysis, making sure that is correct. Yeah. Once we have a good spending goal in there, we've updated The contributions on the 401Ks.

00:36:49.220 --> 00:37:26.770
Speaker 4: you've got the retirement assets that are in the UK. If you can get some statements to us, we can get those updated. And then, as far as those pensions go, if there's, like, a dollar amount, and, like, when it starts, and… you know, some of the, you know, the information on that, we can add that in as other retirement income. Okay. We can start building this up, you know, a little bit more. I'd say this… we're in the preliminary part right here, so I was… I was showing Paula, it… it didn't come with a good result, but like I said, I don't think that matters right now, because we're… we have to find… we have to fine-tune this. Okay.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:31.555
Speaker 4: Okay, so don't worry too much about that.

00:37:31.555 --> 00:37:37.010
Joe Pugh: They don't want me… they don't want me working at 65.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:57.630
Speaker 4: Well, I think… I think once we fine-tuned things a little bit, because before we adjusted the spinning. It was at… It was… it was 95% probability, which is the highest it can be. Oh, okay. You know, so… $xxxxx after tax. I mean, that's, like, what?

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:10.945
Speaker 4: over… What's that per month? Like, it's over xxxx, right? Yeah. I mean, if we're saying we're spending that…

00:38:10.945 --> 00:38:16.945
Joe Pugh: I wonder what we're spending that. I don't know, maybe, yeah, we can look at that.

00:38:16.945 --> 00:38:28.525
Speaker 4: I mean, look at… look at your, that's where the budget's gonna come in. Yeah. Because I… I think, you know, even before I ever did my own budget, I was… I was actually spending more than I thought I would.

00:38:28.525 --> 00:38:30.619
Joe Pugh: Yeah, and, like, we put…

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:33.469
Speaker 4: They're spending more than they are. Yeah.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:49.900
Joe Pugh: And, yeah, because we're putting $xxx a month into the kids' college funds, so I guess that wouldn't… that wouldn't be there anymore, assuming they've graduated by then, I would hope. So, yeah, there's probably… there might be some stuff that's kind of relevant now that won't be relevant then, as well.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.894
Speaker 4: Now, are you doing, like, some kind of state plan.

00:38:54.895 --> 00:39:21.310
Joe Pugh: Yeah, like, it's… was it 529? So we do my 529 for both of those. Those are… I think those are actually shown… When you did all the account listings there, and, like, net worth and stuff, those were the ones that had the, the children's name, so there's, like, Madeline and Elizabeth… sorry, Madeline and Emily. Those two, those are their college funds, individually. Okay.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.950
Speaker 4: Yeah, fun, not used. Yeah.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.105
Joe Pugh: Oh, okay, so not using them, perfect.

00:39:28.105 --> 00:39:30.354
Speaker 4: So they're not even far… they're not even being utilized.

00:39:30.355 --> 00:39:33.250
Joe Pugh: Oh, well, that's perfect, yeah, because obviously, yeah, it's for them, so…

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:39.214
Speaker 4: Did you guys see the recent, the CARE Act 2.0? Did you…

00:39:39.215 --> 00:39:42.319
Joe Pugh: No, not as it relates to that, no.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:40:26.430
Speaker 4: So, one of the changes are… one of the biggest concerns people have about 529 accounts is, what if my… what if my kid gets a scholarship? Or what if they don't go to college, you know? So the concern that Eric is, you've been saving all that 529 money, well, then what do you do with it? So, with the… The… that act that they recently put out, you can… after… it's like 15 years. of the money being in there, you can start converting it to a Roth IRA for them. So that way, it doesn't get stuck in the 529 account, because if you pull money out of the 529 account, it's not used for college, you get gained 10% plus, paying taxes on any of the earnings.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:38.055
Speaker 4: So part of that SECURE Act is allowing money, and you can't do it all the first year, you can do it over time, but they're allowing you to convert those dollars into a Roth IRA for the kids so that.

00:40:38.055 --> 00:40:38.805
Joe Pugh: Perfect, that's really exciting.

00:40:38.805 --> 00:40:48.555
Speaker 4: You know what, if they worked really hard and got a scholarship, well, then they're not getting penalized. They can reward them with saving, helping them save for retirement instead of paying for college.

00:40:48.555 --> 00:40:50.009
Joe Pugh: Oh, that's really good.

00:40:51.290 --> 00:41:10.649
Speaker 4: And you can do that with the Jones accounts now, too. Obviously, that's down the line, but that is available currently with the Ebert Jones accounts. Added that feature to ours, to… to meet the… that SECURE Act that they put out recently. Okay, so I'll get the…

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:24.345
Speaker 4: budgeted, like I said, this is a work in progress. Again, don't, don't be too concerned about that. what kind of questions do you guys have? Is this generating any questions or any.

00:41:24.345 --> 00:41:45.600
Joe Pugh: No, no, this is really useful. So… I… I think I can… I've… for the UK stuff, I can at least get, like, the screen up. I don't know whether they'll give me, like, a printed statement, takes a while to come over, but I can probably get, like, the headline balance of each one, and share that. Yeah, that'd be fine.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:51.225
Speaker 4: At the end of the day, all we really need is, to know, like, kind of how much is in there, you know?

00:41:51.225 --> 00:42:01.060
Joe Pugh: Yeah, I added it up earlier this week, so I have a total number, but whether you wanted to break that down into four things, or just… I can tell you what the number is now if you want, but…

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:19.105
Speaker 4: I think it'd be good to break it down, yeah. Okay, let's do that. Both the breakdowns, I can take those, but, I think it'd be good to break it down, because we can put it, you know, obviously we can assign the different assets to Each of you guys, which… Actually, this is on all lists used, so we need to fix that, too.

00:42:19.105 --> 00:42:28.904
Joe Pugh: Sorry, Paula. It's all listed as zoning by me, but a lot of these are you or joint. Yeah, all of the… all of the, UNC stuff is all smaller, yeah.

00:42:28.905 --> 00:42:32.430
Speaker 4: Yeah. Yeah, so, like, these are listed under Joe, we can just go in.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:51.280
Joe Pugh: That's what I recall. Yeah. Yeah, and I don't know whether… do we put in that we're actively contributing to those as well? Is that useful to know, or… Is this… yeah, because it's… I guess, is it just assuming that they say static, yeah?

00:42:51.830 --> 00:43:00.279
Speaker 4: Yeah, because right now, it looks like you guys aren't contributing. Oh, okay. Nikki update that portion, too. I've got that on my note here. Cool.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:07.410
Joe Pugh: Maybe that'll let us spend that big number. Okay, maybe enough.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:18.925
Speaker 4: So, actually, it looks like there's, like, 3 different… so there's a Core 3B, a 457…

00:43:18.925 --> 00:43:28.434
Joe Pugh: I think… I think the original one was the one you had when you were working at UNC before, and the… these ones… so, Paula was working there.

00:43:28.435 --> 00:43:38.580
Speaker 5: optional retirement one is the… is my default retirement program, and because I'm not in a 401 , I'm eligible for the 403B and the 457B as well, to top it up.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:43.350
Joe Pugh: Right. Okay, so does that one get contributed to as well?

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:52.320
Speaker 5: The one at the bottom? The one at the bottom is my main, what, employee one, and then I contribute individually into the other two. Oh, right. Oh, cool.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.015
Speaker 4: Really, you're contributing for free. Yeah.

00:43:55.015 --> 00:44:07.105
Joe Pugh: Yeah, good for you. You'll be fine. That's why you're… yeah, so basically the paycheck is… it's basically all of that, and the health insurance, and there's not much else, but it's just everything's going…

00:44:07.105 --> 00:44:11.340
Speaker 5: Because I don't… well, I have got a retirement plan from the UK, but I don't…

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:23.909
Joe Pugh: No, but that's… yeah, because… Yeah, because, like, jointly, everything we earn is, like, getting the higher federal, so just… there's just no point in, like, not putting everything into retirement, because we're just giving money away otherwise.

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:37.005
Speaker 4: Well, and since you're doing three, Paula, I would say if you have a breakdown by how much you're contributing to each. We can update the system to include that.

00:44:37.005 --> 00:44:47.809
Joe Pugh: Okay. Yeah, certainly the top two… yeah, the top two ones that say plan at the end, that's just whatever the maximum you're allowed to contribute at our age per year is. That's what's going into those.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.935
Speaker 4: Okay. But then this other one here, the…

00:44:50.935 --> 00:44:52.435
Joe Pugh: Yeah, sure. To see what that is.

00:44:52.435 --> 00:45:01.099
Speaker 5: Yeah, that's just… yeah, that comes out. That's what UNC would also contribute some to, but that's my retirement… that's my standard retirement plan.

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:11.594
Joe Pugh: But yeah, your pay stupid. Yeah, well, actually, last year's… last year's statement, because we were at the right time, I think, to get…

00:45:11.595 --> 00:45:15.070
Speaker 5: I just got an email about that, so I can get that. That's fine.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:34.810
Speaker 4: Okay. Just making some notes here. Okay. Well, I think it's a good start, you know,

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:53.670
Speaker 4: So, like I said, work in progress here. We'll get… we'll get that updated, and then… I can send… once we get this all updated, I can send you, like, a follow-up report, and then… Where you go online, let me see…

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:56.645
Speaker 5: Those ones that I just called Emily and Matt.

00:45:56.645 --> 00:45:58.894
Joe Pugh: Those are their bank accounts.

00:45:58.895 --> 00:46:00.395
Speaker 5: I've listed that as our phone.

00:46:00.395 --> 00:46:16.240
Joe Pugh: I don't know, I didn't… not… I think it just defaults. Yeah. Yeah, we're not gonna steal… Yeah, we're not gonna steal from the kids, and it's not gonna make a difference if we do, really, is it? No, just… Yeah, yeah, we can update those, but yeah.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:40.260
Speaker 4: goes on. Yeah, at the end of the day, honestly, it doesn't that much. I think it's good to see them broken out. Where urgent matter is typically Joe, I'm sorry, typically you die first, in the analysis, so transfer of assets, that kind of thing. Yeah. But other than that, it doesn't really matter too much. Cool.

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:58.500
Speaker 4: But for… online account access, I can't change anything, but I can kind of see what you guys see when you log in. If you go to goals. And then… hold on. Well, that's not what I wanted, hold on.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:02.630
Speaker 4: Supposed to just be under goals.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:08.230
Joe Pugh: Yeah, and I… Well…

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:30.189
Speaker 4: No, it's not quite a king. Yeah, supposed to be in our goals. Okay, I gotta… we gotta call over there and see what's going on, because it's supposed to show up right in here. Clearly, it does not show up.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:35.264
Joe Pugh: Yeah, maybe, maybe if you bump… if you update something on the Money Guide side, maybe it will push an update.

00:47:35.265 --> 00:48:14.959
Speaker 4: or something. Yeah, or maybe if a report hasn't been ran, maybe that's the trigger, because I don't know if… I know this was updated some, but I don't know if a report was ever ran on it or not. Okay. Today… You know, expecting it to show up in there.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:38.209
Speaker 4: We'll see if that does it or not. If it doesn't, then we'll try to figure out why it's not showing up and get that fixed. Okay. But… And true ever Jones fashion, not everything works all the time, right? Yeah. So, I guess then, again, any, you know, any kind of question, anything, anything at all for me right now.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:59.835
Joe Pugh: No, no, I don't think so. So, I think, yeah, if you can maybe drop us a note with the things that we should send you, but I'll get those numbers for the UK staff. And I think there was a couple of other things, like getting a trusted contact. That the, lady at the start of the call mentioned. Nikki.

00:48:59.835 --> 00:49:34.020
Speaker 4: is something that's optional, it's not required, but, you know, it's something you can add in there, and I don't… I'm not sure how Nikki explained it. The way I always explain it is the trusted contact is… If, for whatever reason, we can't get ahold of you… Yeah. So… Teams message, we've emailed, we've sent letters, we're not hearing from you. We can get approval from Fields Provision to reach out to the trusted contact to see what's going on, and figure out how to reach you guys. But the trusted contact has no authority on the account, we will not share any account information with them.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:52.650
Speaker 4: We would only ever reach out to them if we can't get ahold of you. Okay. That's what that's there for. Again, it's optional, you can certainly add one if you want. It's not… it's definitely not required. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Okay. Alright, well, we'll get… I'll get with Nikki.

00:49:53.110 --> 00:50:15.220
Speaker 4: We'll get a message to you guys with exactly what we're needing. I'll send… I'll send you guys a budget worksheet as well. And then once we get all that back, we get everything up to date, we'll get you a report. And then we can go from there. Are you interested at all in exploring

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:21.515
Speaker 4: rebalancing that joint account. Is that of any interest at all? Or is that something I don't really want to…

00:50:21.515 --> 00:50:49.140
Joe Pugh: I think we're probably okay for now, but maybe if, like, the market changes and there's an opportunity to do it. Like, or… or I guess, like, if you could… just show what the… what it… like, to put it into what you'd consider, like, a well-balanced, based on what we talked about, like, what the implicate… what the tax implication might look like, that… that could be useful, because, you know, if it can… if it gets canceled out by the growth pretty quick, then it's, you know, it's still worth doing it.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:51:18.820
Speaker 4: Yeah, I can run a proposal, that would show you an estimate of what capital gains might be, short-term, long-term. And yeah, we can just… we can just run that, and then if you don't like it, just… Scrap it, if you want to proceed, whatever we can, you know, so I'll do that. I'll run a proposal. Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm not trying to create a tax event, you know, like…

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:40.279
Speaker 4: taxes, I think you're better off just leaving it the way it is. Yeah. I think with less international and more U.S. large cap, I think you will get a little better performance out of the account. But it's not like performance has been bad, it's just, in some years. you know, it's just underperformed a little bit, you know, so I think we could squeeze a little bit more out of it, but then you gotta…

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:49.890
Speaker 4: you know, is it worth it, right? Yeah. So… Alright. What else? Anything else? .

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:52.859
Joe Pugh: Oh, no, I don't think so. That's been really good, thank you.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:52:18.915
Speaker 4: Well, I'm glad we got a chance to, you know, chat and meet with each other. So I've got… I've got some homework. You guys got some homework. We'll get that to you, and then we'll go from there, and then… We'll have Nikki kind of reach out and maybe try to reconvene here in the near term, to see how things are different, improved, whatever. And we'll go from there. Wonderful.

00:52:18.915 --> 00:52:21.099
Joe Pugh: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, thank you.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:29.149
Speaker 4: Well, I appreciate you guys' time. You have a good rest of your day, have a good weekend as well. Yeah, yeah, you too. Alright, take care. Thank you. Bye-bye.
